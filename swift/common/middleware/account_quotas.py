    account_quotas is a middleware which blocks write requests (PUT, POST) if a
    given quota (in bytes) is exceeded while DELETE requests are still allowed.

    account_quotas uses the x-account-meta-quota-bytes metadata to store the
    quota. Write requests to this metadata setting are only allowed for
    resellers. There is no quota limit if x-account-meta-quota-bytes is not
    set.

    The following shows an example proxy-server.conf:
