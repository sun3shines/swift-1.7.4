Middleware that will provide Static Large Object (SLO) support.

This feature is very similar to Dynamic Large Object (DLO) support in that
it allows the user to upload many objects concurrently and afterwards
download them as a single object. It is different in that it does not rely
on eventually consistent container listings to do so. Instead, a user
defined manifest of the object segments is used.

----------------------
Uploading the Manifest
----------------------

After the user has uploaded the objects to be concatenated a manifest is
uploaded. The request must be a PUT with the query parameter::

    ?multipart-manifest=put

The body of this request will be an ordered list of files in
json data format. The data to be supplied for each segment is::

    path: the path to the segment (not including account)
          /container/object_name
    etag: the etag given back when the segment was PUT
    size_bytes: the size of the segment in bytes

The format of the list will be::

    json:
    [{"path": "/cont/object",
      "etag": "etagoftheobjectsegment",
      "size_bytes": 1048576}, ...]

The number of object segments is limited to a configurable amount, default
1000. Each segment, except for the final one, must be at least 1 megabyte
(configurable). On upload, the middleware will head every segment passed in and
verify the size and etag of each. If any of the objects do not match (not
found, size/etag mismatch, below minimum size) then the user will receive a 4xx
error response. If everything does match, the user will receive a 2xx response
and the SLO object is ready for downloading.

Behind the scenes, on success, a json manifest generated from the user input is
sent to object servers with an extra "X-Static-Large-Object: True" header
and a modified Content-Type. The parameter: swift_bytes=$total_size will be
appended to the existing Content-Type, where total_size is the sum of all
the included segments' size_bytes. This extra parameter will be hidden from
the user.

Manifest files can reference objects in separate containers, which
will improve concurrent upload speed. Objects can be referenced by
multiple manifests.

-------------------------
Retrieving a Large Object
-------------------------

A GET request to the manifest object will return the concatenation of the
objects from the manifest much like DLO. If any of the segments from the
manifest are not found or their Etag/Content Length no longer match the
connection will drop. In this case a 409 Conflict will be logged in the proxy
logs and the user will receive incomplete results.

The headers from this GET or HEAD request will return the metadata attached
to the manifest object itself with some exceptions::

    Content-Length: the total size of the SLO (the sum of the sizes of
                    the segments in the manifest)
    X-Static-Large-Object: True
    Etag: the etag of the SLO (generated the same way as DLO)

A GET request with the query parameter::

    ?multipart-manifest=get

Will return the actual manifest file itself. This is generated json and does
not match the data sent from the original multipart-manifest=put. This call's
main purpose is for debugging.

When the manifest object is uploaded you are more or less guaranteed that
every segment in the manifest exists and matched the specifications.
However, there is nothing that prevents the user from breaking the
SLO download by deleting/replacing a segment referenced in the manifest. It is
left to the user use caution in handling the segments.

-----------------------
Deleting a Large Object
-----------------------

A DELETE request will just delete the manifest object itself.

A DELETE with a query parameter::

    ?multipart-manifest=delete

will delete all the segments referenced in the manifest and then, if
successful, the manifest itself. The failure response will be similar to
the bulk delete middleware.

------------------------
Modifying a Large Object
------------------------

PUTs / POSTs will work as expected, PUTs will just overwrite the manifest
object for example.

------------------
Container Listings
------------------

In a container listing the size listed for SLO manifest objects will be the
total_size of the concatenated segments in the manifest. The overall
X-Container-Bytes-Used for the container (and subsequently for the account)
will not reflect total_size of the manifest but the actual size of the json
data stored. The reason for this somewhat confusing discrepancy is we want the
container listing to reflect the size of the manifest object when it is
downloaded. We do not, however, want to count the bytes-used twice (for both
the manifest and the segments it's referring to) in the container and account
metadata which can be used for stats purposes.
